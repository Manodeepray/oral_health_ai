# 🦷 OralCare.ai : Oral Cancer Diagnosis Web App using RAG and YOLOv8

Welcome to the repository for the **OralCare.ai**. This web app integrates cutting-edge AI technologies such as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **YOLOv8** to assist in diagnosing and evaluating oral diseases. The system is designed to streamline both **image classification** and **symptom-based prediction**, providing a comprehensive tool for medical professionals.

## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to tackle the challenge of early oral cancer diagnosis using two main approaches:

1. **Image Classification**: Using **YOLOv8** for identifying and classifying oral lesions from images.
2. **Symptom-Based Prediction**: Implementing a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model** to predict cancer grades based on user symptoms and domain-specific PDFs.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **YOLOv8n**: Efficient, lightweight model for image classification of oral lesions.
- **RAG Model**: A hybrid system combining **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **retrieval-based techniques** to make predictions based on user inputs and medical literature.
- **Symptom Matching**: Matches patient-reported symptoms with a database of medical records to evaluate cancer grade.
- **Web Interface with Gradio**: Simple and interactive web app for users to upload images and enter symptoms.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: For image classification of oral lesions.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For symptom-based cancer grade prediction.
- **Gradio**: For building the web interface.
- **LangChain**: Used to integrate the RAG model with document retrieval.
- **Mistral 7B**: Lightweight LLM for question-answering on medical data.
- **TensorFlow**: Used in image processing and model development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## 📊 Methodology

### Image Classification using YOLOv8

The **YOLOv8n** model is trained on a custom dataset of oral lesion images. The model is able to:

- Detect oral lesions in uploaded images.
- Classify lesions as potentially malignant or benign.
- Provide visual feedback by drawing bounding boxes around detected lesions.

### Symptom-Based Cancer Prediction using RAG

The **RAG model** combines **Mistral 7B**, a powerful language model, with document retrieval capabilities. It:

1. Retrieves relevant information from medical PDFs based on patient-reported symptoms.
2. Uses the LLM to process and answer queries related to **oral cancer diagnosis** and **cancer grade evaluation**.
3. Returns a **cancer grade prediction** based on both symptom analysis and retrieved documents.

### Web Interface with Gradio

The user-friendly web interface built with **Gradio** allows users to:

- **Upload oral lesion images** for automatic classification.
- **Input symptoms** for text-based diagnosis and grade prediction.
- **Receive detailed predictions** along with explanations.

## ⚙️ Model Performance

The following metrics were used to evaluate the models:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the correct classification of lesions in images.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: For detecting malignancy from image data.
- **pAUC Score**: Applied in the RAG model to evaluate prediction accuracy against the gold standard (medical PDFs).

**YOLOv8n** achieved an accuracy of **85%** in detecting malignant lesions, while the **RAG model** demonstrated a **90% pAUC score** in predicting cancer grade based on symptoms.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Dataset Expansion**: Collect more oral lesion images to improve YOLOv8’s classification accuracy.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Continue fine-tuning Mistral 7B with specialized oral cancer data to improve text-based predictions.
- **Dashboard for Medical Professionals**: Implement a **dashboard** where doctors can track patient data and predictions over time.
